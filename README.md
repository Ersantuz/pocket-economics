## Manifesto 

The main aim of *PocketEconomics* is to provide an accessible framework for economics' students (or anyone who's interested in learning the basics of economic theory) where users can easily access any spot of economic's knowledge she/he is interested in to.  
  The project wants to challenge the old and deeply settled preconception of "books as the only valid tool to spread structured knowledge", as we believe they are missing the key of modern learning: **interactivity**. Hence, in the long-run, the website wants to provide a structure in which theory is supported by its interactive geometrical representation, allowing a deeper understanding of the examined knowledge.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals:

        As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the project and the team behind.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        As a Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content I am interested to learn or read about.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        The main colours used are:
        - <span style="color:#fbf6ef;"> Bianca</span>, as a relaxing reading background. 
        - <span style="color:#c05c0e;"> Pumpkin Skin</span>, used to make content stand out.
        - <span style="color:#eb971c;"> Carrot Orange</span>, to add some color.  
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Inter font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason Inter isn't being imported into the site correctly. Inter is a font used frequently in notes app, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the team behind the project.

    1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a clear and breaf description of the website purpose with a "Learn More" call to action button.
    1. The user has two options, navigate the website through a clear navigation bar or using the call to action buttons accessible by scrolling down the home page. Both choice will lead to the same results.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    As a Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content I am interested to learn or read about.

    1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
    1. The theory part is designed to allow users to always know the category and the topic she/he is reading about. This aim is reached by highlighting in the navigation bar the section she/he is on, while (for theory sections) a sidebar for widescreens, and an hamburger style menu on mobiles and tablet, will clearly tell the user the topic of the page. Each theory section has a main page in which every topic is accessible through buttons. Finally, inside any topic's page the user can access other topic belonging to the same section through the sidebar and can access the section main page using either the navigation bar or a button at the end of the page.   

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad Air, iPad Mini, iPhone SE, iPhone XR.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On Safari the carousel design doesn't work.
