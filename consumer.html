            <h2>A theory of choices.</h2>
            <p>
                How do people choose? The question is of fundamental importance for economic analysis. In this brief chapter, 
                we introduce the historical development of the theory of choice, which guides many, if not all, fields of economics. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Dawns of utility theory.</h3>
            
            <p>
                At the dawn of economic analysis, economists believed that choice was guided by a psychological object that they named <em>utility</em>. 
                Early philosophers who were indeed called, utilitarians, were the first proponents of this primitive <em>utility theory</em>. Among many, 
                the two more important are @benthamIntroductionPrinciplesMorals1781 and @millStuartUtilitarianism1957. The utility hypothesis was 
                the leading foundation of economics for the first part of its development. Let's check what the content of this hypothesis is. 
                Imagine that a decision maker - who, in modern economics, is often a consumer or a producer - can choose among a collection of objects \(X\). 
                The set \(X\) contains all the possibilities among which the decision maker can choose. To make the content of the theory clear, 
                consider a simple example in which you are at the grocery store and have to buy one among an apple \(\left(a \right)\), a banana \(\left(b \right)\) 
                or a coconut \(\left(c \right)\). These would be the three objects in the choice set, i.e. \(X= \left\{a,b,c \right\}\). According to the theory of early 
                utilitarians, you choose the object that gives you the maximal amount of <em>utility</em>, intended as your psychological satisfaction of consuming one of these three fruits. 
                Assume you prefer apples to both bananas and coconuts, bananas to coconuts, and you just hate coconuts. How can we capture this attitude in terms of utility? Economists 
                employ a mathematical object called a *preference relation*, something linked to your preferences over fruits that relates to these three objects. 
                As we use the symbol \(\geq\) to say that \(4 \geq 3\), let's use the more fancy \(\succsim\) to describe your preferences, i.e. your utility attitudes toward objects of choice. 
                You prefer apples to both bananas and coconuts, so \(a \succsim b\) and \(a \succsim c\) i.e. apples give more utility than bananas and coconuts. Moreover, 
                you like bananas more than coconuts, therefore \(b \succsim c\). To summarize, your taste can be concisely described with the ranking \(a \succsim b \succsim c\). 
                Isn't it cool that we can capture so much information with just a couple of symbols? Now, if you are an economist, you know that your preference relation is the one above, 
                what will you choose at the grocery store? Clearly, you pick the apple \(a\), because it gives you the highest amount of utility when compared to \(b\) and \(c\). 
                So, let's distil the content of the theory from this simple example. According to the early economists, each agent has a ranking over objects of choice that 
                represents how much <em>utility</em> they assign to them. Then, according to this theory, you choose the object that gives you the maximal amount of utility. 
                This theory seems extremely trivial, but let's focus on the power of its content and the implicit assumptions. First, according to this theory, 
                choice is related to a psychological disposition. I invite you to reflect on this feature of the theory. Second, it is very strong, because it allows the economist 
                to represent what the decision maker likes with a very simple ranking \(\succsim\). If you think about it, this tool may be employed in many circumstances of 
                economic relevance: you could prefer a job to the other, cereals rather than yoghurt for breakfast, living in a big city compared to another one etc. 
                However, there is a problem with this theory. Does this psychological quantity of utility exist? Can we measure it? In the next paragraph, 
                we discuss how economists dealt with this problem.
            </p>

            <h3>The revolution of revealed preference theory.</h3>
            
            <p>
                The issue with the old school of utility theory is that there was no way of assessing how much utility a decision maker actually derived from a good. 
                This was in stark contrast with the foundations of the natural sciences, which dealt with magnitudes that could be measured, like speed, length, or weight. 
                How to solve this problem? Can a theory of choice rely on a quantity we are not sure exists and can not measure? 
                The economist @samuelsonFoundationsEconomicAnalysis1948 offered a solution by developing <em>revealed preference theory</em>. The strong feature of his proposal, 
                as we will see, is that it does not rely on any psychological assumption regarding what guides choice. Let's delve into the content of the theory via a simple example. 
                Consider again the choice set of the previous paragraph \(X= \left\{a,b,c \right\}\). Say that we can conduct an experiment and ask a decision maker to choose an 
                element between different collections of objects inside \(X\). First, we ask the decision maker what he would like between \(\left\{a,b \right\}\) and he answers \(a\). 
                Then, we ask him again what he picks between \(\left\{b,c\right\}\) and he answers \(b\). What do we conclude? Well, from the first choice we might infer that he prefers 
                $a$ to \(b\), while from the second we deduce that he prefers \(b\) to \(c\). In the language of the previous section, we conclude that \(a \succsim b\) and that \(b \succsim c\). 
                So, by performing these little experiments with the decision maker we can elicit his preferences over objects in \(X\). Choice reveals preferences, as the name of the theory describes. 
                What is the difference with classical utility theory? Revealed preference theory does not rely on any psychological assumption about how the decision maker chooses, 
                it just states that preferences are identified with choices. Simple but powerful.
            </p>

            <h3>Eliciting subjective beliefs.</h3>
            
            <p>
                If you think that the logic of revealed preference theory is tautological, we here present a glance through one of its applications. 
                Until now, we discussed choice in decision problems under certainty, i.e. in circumstances in which if you choose \(a\) you are sure 
                that you will consume an apple. What about choices under uncertainty? Consider the following situation. You have to go from home to work, 
                and it seems it might rain in the next few minutes. You must choose whether to take an umbrella with you. If you take the umbrella and it 
                rains then you are happy, as you are avoiding getting wet. Instead, if you don't take it and it rains, you will arrive at your workplace 
                in quite bad conditions. However, you do not want to carry an umbrella if it does not rain. @savageFoundationsStatistics1972 developed 
                a theory according to which the economist can not only elicit preferences from choice, but also subjective beliefs about uncertain states of the world. 
                In the setting of the umbrella example the content of this theory is easy to see. If you choose to bring umbrella, you reveal 
                that you believe it is likely that it will rain. Hence, revealed preference theory not only allows to elicit the tastes of the consumer but also his beliefs!
            </p>

            <p>
                You might ask now, why is it so important to discuss the nature of people's preferences and how to elicit them? Because this is key for studying choices 
                of economic relevance. We will see how in the next lectures.
