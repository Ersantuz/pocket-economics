            <h1>The goods market</h1>
            <h2>The composition of GDP</h2>
            <p>The purchase of a machine by a firm, the decision to go to a restaurant by a consumer and
                the purchase of school desks by the national government are clearly very different decisions
                and depend on very different factors. So, if we want to understand what determines the
                demand for goods, it makes sense to decompose aggregate output (GDP) from the point
                of view of the different goods being produced, and from the point of view of the different
                buyers for these goods. </p>
            
            <p>The decomposition of GDP typically used by macroeconomists is: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>First comes <span class="highlight">consumption</span> (which we will denote by the letter <span class="highlight">C</span> when we use algebra). 
                    These are the goods and services purchased by consumers, ranging from food to airline tickets, 
                    to holidays, to new cars and so on. Consumption is by far
                    the largest component of GDP. In 2008, it accounted, on average, for 57.3% of GDP in
                    the EU (EU15), ranging from 46.2% in the Netherlands to 71.2% in Greece. In general,
                    consumption is close to 60% or more of national income in the largest European
                    economies (56.3% in Germany, 57.2% in Spain, 56.7% in France, 59.1% in Italy and up
                    to 64.7% in the UK), whereas in smaller countries consumption tends to be closer to
                    50% of GDP (46.2% in the Netherlands, 46.5% in Sweden, 48.9% in Denmark, 51.4% in
                    Finland and 52.9% in Austria).</li>
                <li>Second comes <span class="highlight">investment (I)</span>, sometimes called fixed investment to distinguish it from
                    inventory investment (which we will discuss shortly). Investment is the sum of nonresidential investment, the purchase by firms of new plants or new machines (from
                    turbines to computers), and residential investment, the purchase by people of new
                    houses or apartments.
                    Non-residential investment and residential investment, and the decisions behind
                    them, have more in common than might first appear. Firms buy machines or plants to
                    produce output in the future. People buy houses or apartments to get housing services
                    in the future. In both cases, the decision to buy depends on the services these goods
                    will yield in the future. Consequently, it makes sense to treat them together. Together,
                    non-residential and residential investment accounted, on average, for 20.8% of GDP in
                    EU15 in 2008, ranging from 16.6% in the UK and 19.6% in Sweden to 29.4% in Spain.</li>
                <li>Third comes <span class="highlight">government spending (G)</span>. This represents the purchases of goods and
                    services by the national, regional and local governments. The goods range from aeroplanes to office equipment. The services include services provided by government
                    employees: in effect, the national income accounts treat the government as buying the
                    services provided by government employees – and then providing these services to
                    the public, free of charge.
                    Note that G does not include <span class="highlight">government transfers</span> 
                    (for instance, unemploymentbenefits and pensions), or interest payments on the government debt. 
                    Although these are clearly government expenditures, they are not purchases of goods and services. In
                    2008, government spending accounted on average for 20.9% of GDP in EU15. With the
                    notable exception of Germany, where government expenditure is relatively lower, the
                    largest European countries are all close to the average (the UK slightly above with
                    21.9%), whereas government spending accounts for particularly high shares of GDP in
                    northern European countries (22.1% in Finland, 23.0% in Belgium, 25.0% in the
                    Netherlands, 26.4% in Sweden and 26.5% in Denmark).</li>
                    <li>The sum of the first three ponits gives the purchases of goods and services by resident consumers, resident firms and the government. To determine the purchases of domestic goods
                        and services, two more steps are needed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>First, we must subtract <span class="highlight">imports (IM)</span>, the purchases of foreign goods and services by
                                domestic consumers, domestic firms, and the government.</li>
                            <li>Second, we must add <span class="highlight">exports (X)</span>, the purchases of domestic goods and services by
                                foreigners.</li>
                        </ol>
                        The difference between exports and imports (X – IM) is called <span class="highlight">net exports</span>, or the
                        <span class="highlight">trade balance</span>. If exports exceed imports, the country is said to run a trade surplus. If
                        exports are less than imports, the country is said to run a trade deficit. In 2008, exports
                        from EU15 accounted for 40.0% of GDP and imports were equal to 39.4% of GDP,
                        so EU15 had a trade surplus equal to 0.6% of GDP. Again, this average hides substantial
                        differences across countries: Belgium, Italy, Spain and the UK were running trade
                        deficits, while most northern European countries, as well as Germany, Denmark and the
                        Netherlands, had considerable trade surpluses</li>
                    <li>So far we have looked at various sources of purchases (sales) of domestic goods and services in 2008. To determine national production in 2008, we need to take one last step.
                        In any given year, production and sales need not be equal. Some of the goods produced
                        in a given year are not sold in that year, but in later years. And some of the goods sold in
                        a given year may have been produced in an earlier year. The difference between goods
                        produced and goods sold in a given year – the difference between production and sales,
                        in other words – is called <span class="highlight">inventory investment</span>. If production exceeds sales and firms
                        accumulate inventories as a result, then inventory investment is said to be positive. If
                        production is less than sales, and firms inventories fall, then inventory investment is said
                        to be negative. Inventory investment is typically small – positive in some years and negative
                        in others. In 2008, inventory investment was positive, equal to just a43 billion, or 0.4% of
                        GDP. Put another way, production was higher than sales by an amount equal to a43 billion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Demand For Goods</h2>
            <p>Denote the total demand for goods by Z. Using the decomposition of GDP we saw above, we can write Z as:</p>
            <p>$$Z \equiv C + I + G + X - IM$$</p>
            <p>This equation is an identity (which is why it is written using the symbol ≡ rather than an
                equals sign). It defines Z as the sum of consumption, plus investment, plus government
                spending, plus exports, minus imports. We now need to think about the determinants of Z. To make the task easier, let’s first
                make a number of simplifications:
                <ol>
                    <li>Assume that all firms produce the same good, which can then be used by consumers for
                        consumption, by firms for investment or by the government. With this (big) simplification, we need to look at only one market – the market for ‘the’ good – and think about
                        what determines supply and demand in that market.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assume that firms are willing to supply any amount of the good at a given price, P. This
                        assumption allows us to focus on the role demand plays in the determination of output.
                        As we shall see later in the book, this assumption is valid only in the short run. When we
                        move to the study of the medium run, we will abandon it but, for
                        the moment, it will simplify our discussion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assume that the economy is closed – that it does not trade with the rest of the world: both
                        exports and imports are zero. This assumption clearly goes against the facts: modern
                        economies trade with the rest of the world. Later on (starting in Chapter 6), we will abandon this assumption as well and look at what happens when the economy is open but, for
                        the moment, this assumption will also simplify our discussion because we won’t have to
                        think about what determines exports and imports.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Under the assumption that the economy is closed, X = IM = 0, so the demand for goods,
                Z, is simply the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending:
            </p>
            <p>$$Z \equiv C + I + G$$</p>
