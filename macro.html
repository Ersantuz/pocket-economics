            <h1><span class="highlight">Macroeconomics</span>.</h1>
            <p>Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies how an overall economy—the market or other systems that operate on a large scale—behaves. Macroeconomics studies economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product (GDP), and changes in unemployment.</p>

                  <h1>Macroeconomic Schools of Thought</h1>
                  <h2>Classical</h2>
                  <p>Classical economists held that prices, wages, and rates are flexible and markets tend to clear unless prevented from doing so by government policy, building on Adam Smith's original theories. The term “classical economists” is not actually a school of macroeconomic thought, but a label applied first by Karl Marx and later by Keynes to denote previous economic thinkers with whom they respectively disagreed, but who themselves did not actually differentiate macroeconomics from microeconomics at all. </p>
                  <h2>Keynesian</h2>
                  <p>Keynesian economics was largely founded on the basis of the works of John Maynard Keynes, and was the beginning of macroeconomics as a separate area of study from microeconomics. Keynesians focus on aggregate demand as the principal factor in issues like unemployment and the business cycle. Keynesian economists believe that the business cycle can be managed by active government intervention through fiscal policy (spending more in recessions to stimulate demand) and monetary policy (stimulating demand with lower rates). Keynesian economists also believe that there are certain rigidities in the system, particularly sticky prices that prevent the proper clearing of supply and demand.</p>
                  <h2>Monetarist</h2>
                  <p>The Monetarist school is a branch of Keynesian economics largely credited to the works of Milton Friedman. Working within and extending Keynesian models, Monetarists argue that monetary policy is generally a more effective and more desirable policy tool to manage aggregate demand than fiscal policy. Monetarists also acknowledge limits to monetary policy that make fine tuning the economy ill advised and instead tend to prefer adherence to policy rules that promote stable rates of inflation.</p>
                  <h2>New Classical</h2>
                  <p>The New Classical school, along with the New Keynesians, is built largely on the goal of integrating microeconomic foundations into macroeconomics in order to resolve the glaring theoretical contradictions between the two subjects. The New Classical school emphasizes the importance of microeconomics and models based on that behavior. New Classical economists assume that all agents try to maximize their utility and have rational expectations, which they incorporate into macroeconomic models. New Classical economists believe that unemployment is largely voluntary and that discretionary fiscal policy is destabilizing, while inflation can be controlled with monetary policy.</p>
                  <h2>New Keynesian</h2>
                  <p>The New Keynesian school also attempts to add microeconomic foundations to traditional Keynesian economic theories. While New Keynesians do accept that households and firms operate on the basis of rational expectations, they still maintain that there are a variety of market failures, including sticky prices and wages. Because of this "stickiness", the government can improve macroeconomic conditions through fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
                  <h2>Austrian</h2>
                  <p>The Austrian School is an older school of economics that is seeing some resurgence in popularity. Austrian economic theories mostly apply to microeconomic phenomena, but because they, like the so-called classical economists never strictly separated micro- and macroeconomics, Austrian theories also have important implications for what are otherwise considered macroeconomic subjects. In particular the Austrian business cycle theory explains broadly synchronized (macroeconomic) swings in economic activity across markets as a result of monetary policy and the role that money and banking play in linking (microeconomic) markets to each other and across time. </p>
